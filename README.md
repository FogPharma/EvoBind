# EvoBind
In silico directed evolution of peptide binders with [AlphaFold2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2)
\
**EvoBind** designs peptide binders towards user-specified target residues using only sequence information. EvoBind accounts for adaptation of the receptor interface structure to the peptide design during optimization. This consideration of flexibility is crucial for binding.
